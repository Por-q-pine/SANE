# Cactus Coding
 - this code is meant to be easier to use then Python, but more oporatable than JavaScript, and HTML with CSS.
# Setting Variables
 - a variable is equal to any set of stand-alone numbers and letters such as Ring
 - a string is equal to any set of numbers and letters next to a semicolon such as ;Frodo
 - a boolean is equal to the strings true, false, null, and fill
 - the booleans true, false, and null are easy to understand but fill is new, is a variable in itself which later will be equal to something printed to it.
 - to set a string to a variable use Ring;Frodo
 - to set a boolean to a variable use a colon instead like this Ring:true, Ring:false, Ring:null, Ring:fill:1 the 1 can be anything. It will be what determines which statement is printed to it
# Printing
 - to print at all use 'sendto'
 - to print to console use 'sendto1'
 - to print to a fill boolean use 'sendto2'
